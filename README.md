Use cases:
- Dynamic Art and Collectibles plugins for Metaplex Core NFTs that allow AI to dynamically manage art pieces. Imagine owning art that evolves with your actions, has an intrinsic value inventory, or even responds to market trends. These NFTs could use AI to create evolving visuals, adding a unique programmed value to each piece.
- Gaming Assets with AI Behaviors (custom rule sets for pNFTs), my vision is to introduce game assets that learn and adapt. This means weapons that evolve and can be upgraded through gameplay or characters that develop new skills... all managed through special route guards for fair play and evolution based on player interaction.
- AI-Generated Music or Audio NFTs is where I see a future of NFTs that adapt to the visual environment around you. Using AI plugins, your NFT could generate new compositions or remixes, controlled by custom rules that respect artist rights while offering listeners a fresh auditory experience.
- Educational Tools are essential as to create NFTs that grow with the learner. AI could adjust educational content dynamically, using route guards to filter content that only benefits learning and practical development, making education tailored and highly accessable.
- Legal and Intelectual Property Management can be managed smart using AIs and custom rules to automate governance rights, royalties, and even licensing.

Note: This project is more than just coding, it's about crafting a future where blockchain assets are not just static, but evolving digital entities with intrinsic value.
